# Sunspot Prediction using RNNs and LSTMs

This project aims to predict future sunspot activity using time series data and deep learning techniques like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The dataset contains historical records of sunspot observations, which will be preprocessed and split into training and testing sets. The model will be built using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework, and its performance will be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Contributions to this project are welcome.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install tensorflow`.
3. Download and place the sunspot dataset in the appropriate directory.

## Usage

Run the jupyter notebook in your IDE (colab recommended)

## Results

The model's accuracy will be evaluated using various metrics and visualized through plots.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.
