# Dialogue Summarization with Generative AI

Welcome to the **Dialogue Summarization with Generative AI** project! In this project, you will delve into the fascinating realm of natural language processing and explore the capabilities of generative AI models. Your main goal is to perform dialogue summarization using cutting-edge language models and investigate how different input techniques impact the quality of generated summaries.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will embark on a journey to understand and harness the power of generative AI for dialogue summarization. By leveraging large language models, you'll explore how variations in input text influence the model's output. Through the process of prompt engineering, you'll fine-tune the model's behavior to align with your summarization task. Specifically, you will:

1. **Investigate Input-Output Relationship:** Study how the content and structure of input dialogues influence the quality and relevance of the generated summaries.

2. **Prompt Engineering:** Develop and refine techniques to construct prompts that guide the model towards producing desired summarization outputs.

3. **Comparison of Inference Techniques:** Compare and analyze the performance of different inference strategies, including zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences, to gain insights into their effectiveness for dialogue summarization.

4. **Enhancing Generative Output:** Take the first steps in harnessing prompt engineering to enhance the output quality of large language models, paving the way for improved generative AI applications.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several key components:

- **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Gather and preprocess a dataset of dialogues for training and evaluation.

- **Model Selection and Fine-tuning:** Choose a suitable generative AI model and fine-tune it for dialogue summarization.

- **Prompt Engineering:** Develop prompt engineering strategies to guide the model's behavior and align it with the summarization task.

- **Inference and Evaluation:** Implement various inference techniques (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) and evaluate their impact on summary quality.

- **Analysis and Insights:** Compare results, analyze the model's behavior, and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of different input techniques and prompt engineering.
